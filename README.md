# incremental-sync

This repository contains the code for incremental and periodic sync of Azure resources, subscriptions and resources groups (Azure Resources are prioritized in detail) into Port.

The code is written in Python and uses the Azure SDK for Python to interact with Azure resources. It is designed to be run in a GitHub workflow in periodic intervals to keep the Port data up-to-date.
